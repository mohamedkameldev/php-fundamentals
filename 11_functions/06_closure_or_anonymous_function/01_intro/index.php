 * Named function:

 * Anonymous functions:
 *      function that doesnâ€™t have a name.
 *      you need to end it with a semicolon (;) because PHP treats it as an expression.
 *      you need to assign it to a variable and call the function via the variable.
 *      (if you don't assign it to a variable, it will be useless because you can't call it at any place).
 *
 * An anonymous function is a Closure object.
