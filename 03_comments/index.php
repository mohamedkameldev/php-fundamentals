/*
 * PHP supports two types of comments:
 * One-line comments: // or #
 * Multi-line comments: /*  */

# Important Tips:


// 1- Making the code speak for itself without using comments by naming meaningful identifiers.
$is_completed;   // (do that)
$ic;             // (don't do that)

// 2- Don’t write a comment to explain what code does, instead, explain why it does so. For example:
$ic = true;             // this is is_compolete variable (don't do that)
$is_completed = true;   // complete the task   (do that)

// 3-  When writing a comment, make it as concise as possible.
