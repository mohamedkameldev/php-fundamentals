 * Use if statements:
 *  when you have complex conditions, multiple variables, or ranges to check.
 *
 *  if statements are more flexible than switch cases.
 *
 *
 *
 * Use switch cases:
 *  when you are dealing with a single variable that can take on many discrete values.
 *
 *  switch cases improve readability and performance(when dealing with a single variable).
