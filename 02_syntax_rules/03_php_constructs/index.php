/**
 * Construct refers to language elements that are built into the syntax of the language itself.
 *
 * Constructs are fundamental parts of PHP's grammar,
 * and are used to define control structures, output data, handle variables, and more.
 *
 * Constructs are integral to the PHP syntax and are parsed directly by the PHP interpreter.
 *
 * Constructs are generally more efficient in terms of execution compared to functions or methods,
 * because they are part of the language core and are optimized for direct parsing and execution.
 *
 * examples of constructs:
 *      echo and print
 *      if, else, for, foreach, while, etc.
 *      function, class, trait, interface, ...
 *      include, require
 *      return
 *      exit, die
 *      Variable declaration ($variable = value;)
 *      Class declaration (class ClassName { ... }
 *      Namespace declaration (namespace NamespaceName;
