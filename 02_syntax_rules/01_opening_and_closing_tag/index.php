<?php

/**
 * If you mix PHP code with HTML, you must write the enclosing tag <?php   ?>
 *
 * If a file contains only PHP code, the enclosing tag is optional
 * (but it's prefable to don't write it).
 *
 * Shorter way to show the value of a variable on a page: <?= $variable_name ?>
 *
 *
 *
 * <?php echo $name ?> = <?php echo $name; ?>
 * The closing tag of a PHP block (?>) automatically implies a semicolon (;).
 * Therefore, you donâ€™t need to place a semicolon in the last statement in a PHP block.
