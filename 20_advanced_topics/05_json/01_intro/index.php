/** JSON = javascript object notation.
 * JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format.
 * JSON is built on two structures:
 * 1- a collection of name/value pairs called JSON objects (equivalent to associative arrays in PHP).
 * 2- an ordered list of values called arrays (equivalent to indexed arrays in PHP).
 * JSON extension in PHP provides some handy functions to convert data from PHP to JSON and vice versa.
 *
 * PHP variable to json : json_encode
 * json to PHP variable : json_decode
