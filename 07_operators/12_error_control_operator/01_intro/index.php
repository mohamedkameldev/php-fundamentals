/** Important Notes:
 * @ operator can be handy in specific scenarios,it hides errors that might need to be addressed.
 *
 * Suppressing errors can make debugging difficult and can lead to unnoticed issues in the code
 *
 * The @ operator has a performance overhead because it alters the error reporting mechanism.
 *
 * It's usually better to handle errors gracefully using proper error handling techniques,
 * (such as try-catch blocks for exceptions or checking the return values of functions that might fail).
